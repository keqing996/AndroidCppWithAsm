The project builds an APK file, which runs as follows:

The string displayed in the center is actually loaded from the assembly code. In the assembly, 
the string is directly written into the .rodata segment. In the C++ code, the assembly 
functions are declared using extern and linked with the object files generated by the 
assembler. C++ then passes the string to Java via JNI, resulting in the string being 
displayed on the screen.
